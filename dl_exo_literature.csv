To date, more than 4300 exoplanets have been confirmed by NASA, using various discovery techniques, including planetary transits, in addition to the use of various databases provided by space and ground-based telescopes. This article proposes the development of a deep learning system for detecting planetary transits in Kepler Telescope light curves. The approach is based on related work from the literature and enhanced to validation with real light curves. A CNN classification model is trained from a mixture of real and synthetic data. The model is then validated only with unknown real data. The best ratio of synthetic data is determined by the performance of an optimisation technique and a sensitivity analysis. The precision, accuracy and true positive rate of the best model obtained are determined and compared with other similar works. The results demonstrate that the use of synthetic data on the training stage can improve the transit detection performance on real light curves.",,"This research was supported in part by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) under Projects FONDECYT 1191188 and 1190486, and PhD Scholarship 21221393.

2194,pub.1099999786,10.1051/0004-6361/201731961,,,Supervised detection of exoplanets in high-contrast imaging sequences,"Context.
                    Post-processing algorithms play a key role in pushing the detection limits of high-contrast imaging (HCI) instruments. State-of-the-art image processing approaches for HCI enable the production of science-ready images relying on unsupervised learning techniques, such as low-rank approximations, for generating a model point spread function (PSF) and subtracting the residual starlight and speckle noise.
                  
                  
                    Aims.
                    In order to maximize the detection rate of HCI instruments and survey campaigns, advanced algorithms with higher sensitivities to faint companions are needed, especially for the speckle-dominated innermost region of the images.
                  
                  
                    Methods.
                    We propose a reformulation of the exoplanet detection task (for ADI sequences) that builds on well-established machine learning techniques to take HCI post-processing from an unsupervised to a supervised learning context. In this new framework, we present algorithmic solutions using two different discriminative models: SODIRF (random forests) and SODINN (neural networks). We test these algorithms on real ADI datasets from VLT/NACO and VLT/SPHERE HCI instruments. We then assess their performances by injecting fake companions and using receiver operating characteristic analysis. This is done in comparison with state-of-the-art ADI algorithms, such as ADI principal component analysis (ADI-PCA).
                  
                  
                    Results.
                    This study shows the improved sensitivity versus specificity trade-off of the proposed supervised detection approach. At the diffraction limit, SODINN improves the true positive rate by a factor ranging from ~2 to ~10 (depending on the dataset and angular separation) with respect to ADI-PCA when working at the same false-positive level.
                  
                  
                    Conclusions.
                    The proposed supervised detection framework outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in the task of discriminating planet signal from speckles. In addition, it offers the possibility of re-processing existing HCI databases to maximize their scientific return and potentially improve the demographics of directly imaged exoplanets.",The authors would like to thank the python open-source scientific community and the developers of the Keras deep learning library.

The exoplanet signals can only be identified when com-bining several observations with dedicated detection algorithms. In contrast to most of existing methods, we propose to learn a model of the spatial, temporal and spectral characteristics of the nuisance, directly from the observations. In a pre-processing step, a statistical model of their correlations is built locally, and the data are centered and whitened to improve both their stationarity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A convolutional neural network (CNN) is then trained in a supervised fashion to detect the residual signature of synthetic sources in the pre-processed images. Our method leads to a better trade-off between precision and recall than standard approaches in the field. It also outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm based solely on a statistical framework. Besides, the exploitation of the spectral diversity improves the performance compared to a similar model built solely from spatio-temporal data.",,"The work of OF, ML, and AML was supported in part by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (COBREX; n° 885593).

Supervised deep learning was recently introduced in high-contrast imaging (HCI) through the SODINN algorithm, a con-volutional neural network designed for exoplanet detection in angular differential imaging (ADI) datasets. The benchmarking of HCI algorithms within the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge (EIDC) showed that (i) SODINN can produce a high number of false positives in the final detection maps, and (ii) algorithms processing images in a more local manner perform better.   Aims . This work aims to improve the SODINN detection performance by introducing new local processing approaches and adapting its learning process accordingly.   Methods . We propose NA-SODINN, a new deep learning binary classifier based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that better captures image noise correlations in ADI-processed frames by identifying noise regimes. The identification of these noise regimes is based on a novel technique, named PCA-pmaps, which allowed us to estimate the distance from the star in the image from which background noise started to dominate over residual speckle noise. NA-SODINN was also fed with local discriminators, such as signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) curves, which complement spatio-temporal feature maps during the model’s training.   Results . Our new approach was tested against its predecessor, as well as two SODINN-based hybrid models and a more standard annular-PCA approach, through local receiving operating characteristics (ROC) analysis of ADI sequences from the VLT/SPHERE and Keck/NIRC-2 instruments. Results show that NA-SODINN enhances SODINN in both sensitivity and specificity, especially in the speckle-dominated noise regime. NA-SODINN is also benchmarked against the complete set of submitted detection algorithms in EIDC, in which we show that its final detection score matches or outperforms the most powerful detection algorithms.   Conclusions . Throughout the supervised machine learning case, this study illustrates and reinforces the importance of adapting the task of detection to the local content of processed images.","The authors would like to thank the python open-source scientific community, and in particular the developers of the Keras deep learning library (Abadi et al. 2015) and the VIP high-contrast imaging package (Gomez Gonzalez et al. 2017; Christiaens et al. 2023).

1821,pub.1149527420,10.1117/12.2629849,,,Exoplanet detection in angular differential imaging: combining a statistics-based learning with a deep-based learning for improved detections,"Direct imaging is an active research topic in astronomy for the detection and the characterization of young substellar objects. The very high contrast between the host star and its companions makes detection particularly challenging. In addition to the use of an extreme adaptive optics system and a coronagraph to strongly attenuate the starlight contamination, dedicated post-processing methods combining several images recorded with the pupil tracking mode of the telescope are needed. In previous works, we have presented the PACO algorithm capturing the spatial correlations of the data with a multi-variate Gaussian model whose parameters are estimated in a data-driven fashion at the scale of a patch of a few tens of pixels. PACO is parameter free and delivers reliable detection confidences with an improved sensitivity compared to the standard methods of the field (e.g., cADI, PCA, TLOCI ). However, there is a room for improvement in the detection sensitivity due to the approximate fidelity of the PACO statistical model with respect to the observations. We propose to combine the statistics-based model of PACO with a deep learning approach in a three-step algorithm. First, the data are centered and whitened locally using the PACO framework to improve the stationarity and the contrast in a preprocessing step. Second, a convolutional neural network is trained in a supervised fashion to detect the signature of synthetic sources in the preprocessed science data. The network is trained from scratch with a custom data augmentation strategy allowing to generate a large training set from a single spatio-temporal dataset. Finally, the trained network is applied to the preprocessed observations and delivers a detection map. We apply our method on eleven datasets from the VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS instrument and compare our method with PACO and other baselines of the field (cADI, PCA). Our results show that the proposed method performs on-par with or better than these algorithms, with a contrast improvement up to half a magnitude with respect to PACO.",,,Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering,Adaptive Optics Systems VIII,"Dirk Schmidt, Laura Schreiber, Elise Vernet",,2022-08-30,2022,,,12185,,121853s-121853s-14,All OA; Green,Proceeding,"Flasseur, Olivier; Bodrito, Théo; Mairal, Julien; Ponce, Jean; Langlois, Maud; Lagrange, Anne-Marie","Flasseur, Olivier (Lab. d'Etudes Spatiales et d'Instrumentation en Astrophysique, Observatoire de Paris (France)); Bodrito, Théo (Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique, ENS-PSL, CNRS (France)); Mairal, Julien (Univ.

The standard method employs angular differential imaging (ADI) technique, and more ADI image frames could lead to the results with larger signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). However, it would need precious observational time from large telescopes, which are always over-subscribed. We thus explore the possibility to generate a converter which can increase the SNR derived from a smaller number of ADI frames. The machine learning technique with two-dimension convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) is tested here. Several 2D-CNN models are trained and their performances of denoising are presented and compared. It is found that our proposed Modified five-layer Wide Inference Network with the Residual learning technique and Batch normalization (MWIN5-RB) can give the best result.

Further advances in exoplanet detection and characterisation require sampling a diverse population of extrasolar planets. One technique to detect these distant worlds is through the direct detection of their thermal emission. The so-called direct imaging technique, is suitable for observing young planets far from their star. These are very low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) measurements and limited ground truth hinders the use of supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we combine deep generative and discriminative models to bypass the issues arising when directly training on real data. We use a Generative Adversarial Network to obtain a suitable dataset for training Convolutional Neural Network classifiers to detect and locate planets across a wide range of SNRs. Tested on artificial data, our detectors exhibit good predictive performance and robustness across SNRs. To demonstrate the limits of the detectors, we provide maps of the precision and recall of the model per pixel of the input image.

Underpinning both the development and successful deployment of future direct imaging missions is the ability to analyze the resulting data. Therefore, in order to inform noise budget requirements and fully leverage high-resolution direct images, it is critical to develop post-processing algorithms that are versatile, efficient, and reliable. This work leverages recent advancements in starshade simulation technology and presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting exoplanet signals from direct images. The proposed architecture modifies U-Net, a semantic segmentation architecture, to directly regress the coordinate location of exoplanet signals from a synthetic star-shade imaging dataset. Results from a limited test set of 144 images indicate that the CNN achieves an average precision and recall of 0.925 ± 0.012 and 0.923 ± 0.018, respectively. Additionally, the CNN does not require processing the data through conventional background estimation algorithms prior to detection and performs inference on single images, showcasing the potential of supervised machine learning as a versatile approach for exoplanet detection.",,,Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering,Techniques and Instrumentation for Detection of Exoplanets XI,Garreth J.

1548,pub.1164930280,10.1093/mnras/stad3143,,,deep PACO: combining statistical models with deep learning for exoplanet detection and characterization in direct imaging at high contrast,"ABSTRACT Direct imaging is an active research topic in astronomy for the detection and the characterization of young substellar objects. The very high contrast between the host star and its companions makes the observations particularly challenging. In this context, post-processing methods combining several images recorded with the pupil tracking mode of telescope are needed. In previous works, we have presented a data-driven algorithm, PACO, capturing locally the spatial correlations of the data with a multivariate Gaussian model. PACO delivers better detection sensitivity and confidence than the standard post-processing methods of the field. However, there is room for improvement due to the approximate fidelity of the PACO statistical model to the time evolving observations. In this paper, we propose to combine the statistical model of PACO with supervised deep learning. The data are first pre-processed with the PACO framework to improve the stationarity and the contrast. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is then trained in a supervised fashion to detect the residual signature of synthetic sources. Finally, the trained network delivers a detection map. The photometry of detected sources is estimated by a second CNN. We apply the proposed approach to several data sets from the VLT/SPHERE instrument. Our results show that its detection stage performs significantly better than baseline methods (cADI and PCA), and leads to a contrast improvement up to half a magnitude compared to PACO. The characterization stage of the proposed method performs on average on par with or better than the comparative algorithms (PCA and PACO) for angular separation above 0.5 arcsec.","We thank the anonymous referee for her/his careful reading of the manuscript as well as her/his insightful comments and suggestions.

the range of fresh data available for research, and manually handling them is
both time-consuming and difficult. Machine learning and deep learning
techniques can greatly assist in lowering human efforts to process the vast
array of data produced by the modern instruments of these exoplanet programs in
an economical and unbiased manner. However, care should be taken to detect all
the exoplanets precisely while simultaneously minimizing the misclassification
of non-exoplanet stars. In this paper, we utilize two variations of generative
adversarial networks, namely semi-supervised generative adversarial networks
and auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks, to detect transiting
exoplanets in K2 data. We find that the usage of these models can be helpful
for the classification of stars with exoplanets. Both of our techniques are

Using a variety of techniques, including gravitational microlensing, direct imaging, astrometry, and the radial velocity approach, more than 5,000 exoplanets have been found. The majority of confirmed exoplanet discoveries, have been made using the transit method. The machine learning (ML) models used in earlier approaches for prediction of exoplanets involve usage of large datasets and complex architectures, which takes a lot of time for training and hence detection of exoplanets.This work has presented a novel exoplanet detection approach based on the Object Detection algorithm- You only look once (YOLO). The data was collected for 221 confirmed exoplanets detected by Telescope and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and light curves were downloaded for the same. The annotations were generated around the brightness dips in the light curves, followed by YOLO-object detection. The presented work not only predicts the dips in brightness in the light curve accurately but also takes less time to train the proposed model.The work has achieved a mAP 0.5 of 0.82, a precision of 0.85, and a recall of 0.81.

Exoplanet detection and characterization by direct imaging both rely on sophisticated instruments (adaptive optics and coronagraph) and adequate data processing methods. Angular and spectral differential imaging (ASDI) combines observations at different times and a range of wavelengths in order to separate the residual signal from the host star and the signal of interest corresponding to off-axis sources.   Aims. Very high contrast detection is only possible with an accurate modeling of those two components, in particular of the background due to stellar leakages of the host star masked out by the coronagraph. Beyond the detection of point-like sources in the field of view, it is also essential to characterize the detection in terms of statistical significance and astrometry and to estimate the source spectrum.   Methods. We extend our recent method PACO , based on local learning of patch covariances, in order to capture the spectral and temporal fluctuations of background structures. From this statistical modeling, we build a detection algorithm and a spectrum estimation method: PACO ASDI . The modeling of spectral correlations proves useful both in reducing detection artifacts and obtaining accurate statistical guarantees (detection thresholds and photometry confidence intervals).   Results. An analysis of several ASDI datasets from the VLT/SPHERE-IFS instrument shows that PACO ASDI produces very clean detection maps, for which setting a detection threshold is statistically reliable. Compared to other algorithms used routinely to exploit the scientific results of SPHERE-IFS, sensitivity is improved and many false detections can be avoided. Spectrally smoothed spectra are also produced by PACO ASDI . The analysis of datasets with injected fake planets validates the recovered spectra and the computed confidence intervals.   Conclusions. PACO ASDI is a high-contrast processing algorithm accounting for the spatio-spectral correlations of the data to produce statistically-grounded detection maps and reliable spectral estimations. Point source detections, photometric and astrometric characterizations are fully automatized.","We thank A. Boccaletti (LESIA, Paris, France) who provided the transmission of the SPHERE coronagraphs.
